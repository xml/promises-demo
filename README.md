promises-demo
=============

Shell project for Javascript promises talk, designed to facilitate easy interaction with some promise objects. 
For this reason, we've broken all kinds of good practices, to make it easier to inspect what we're working on. 

You should only need to work on app.js. Complete the areas marked `//IMPLEMENT`
Open `index.html` in your browser to interact with your work. 

Use the buttons there to interact with a Promise:

1. Create one
2. Inspect it
3. Ask it if it's fulfilled or not?
4. Resolve it.
5. Repeat #'s 2 & 3.
6. Create another one (same button)
7. Reject it.
8. Repeat #'s 2 & 3.
9. Create another one. 
10. Try adding a handler & see what happens.
11. Resolve it, see what happens. 
9. Create another one. 
10. add a handler
11. Reject it, see what happens.
12. Add another handler!
